# Changelog

## Add reusable devmods development loading

- Add drag-and-drop support for RFG-remapped production mod jars and already-deobfuscated development jars.
- Keep local compatibility-testing mods isolated from release artifacts and publication metadata.

## Update spectator mode

- Maintain ambient Night Vision and Invisibility potion effects while a player is in Et Futurum spectator mode without replacing pre-existing effects.
- Synchronize remote players' Et Futurum spectator state and hide those players from JourneyMap 5.1.4 radar when that optional client mod is present.
- Allow builds without the optional JourneyMap mod on the compile classpath while retaining strict validation for other mixins.

## Fix recursive chunk-loading `StackOverflowError` (#701)

- Guard entity replacement chunk access so `EntityJoinWorldEvent` never force-loads an absent neighboring chunk.
- Keep the original entity alive and its join event active when replacement cannot be completed.
